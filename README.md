## Development description

Started creating the app by setting up simple component structure. Then in order to work around CORS and to reach API, I created a small node server.
I used it as well to easily get all cards list in one place, since the deck is custom and there is no way to get that from yu-gi-oh API.
Finally finished wiring up components together and put some styling on them. All coding was done concurrently with testing.
